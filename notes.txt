
note: all the values/info are hardcoded. This started as a small project that has been steadily growing. At this point, it's 
easier to keep using that format than it is refactoring.

modificados:
extra_books, career info, talent info, npccreator, talents, species, names, finalDetails, name_info, forms, career

 
 
to add new books:
 add them to info/extra_books.py, following the format within. Then, add them in /forms.py on book_list
  
  For careers, add them to info.career_info, following the format within. Then, add the event listener and function 
  in npccreator.html (I couldn't get pythonanywhere to detect the js file, so I had to embed it there)

  for species, add them into the book dictionary in extra_books.py. Later, you'll have to enter the corresponding exception on
  species, names, finalDetails, in case of being an elf, dwarf, halfling or human

  If there are new skills/talents, make sure to add them on info.detailed_skills or info.talent_info


  10.2:
   Added careers and species from Up in Arms. Should be working reasonably well. 
   The tilean names were taken from a Warhammer Fantasy Wiki and Up in Arms, plus a few more Italian names for women, since otherwise there'd be too few of them
   Pending bug: when creating a character from a non-core species, the species selector unchecks itself.
